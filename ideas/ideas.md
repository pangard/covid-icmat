# IDEAS FOR CV PROJECT

* For a person who has been detected as ill, we locate his home,
workplace, etc... If their mobile trace is given we can find all
his stationary locations where he possibly left droplets
All in all we associate a bunch of geofences to an ill person
First, this may be displayed on a map (with some graduation
of the recency in tieme). For an app user, at any time we can trace how many marked
places  he has been located. As a consequence we provide some risk index.
